# Terraform Environments

In this project, we use Terraform environments to create AWS accounts for different purposes. Each environment represents a separate AWS account with its own resources and configurations.

## Environment Structure

The Terraform environments are organized as follows:

- **Dev Environment**: Used for development and testing purposes. It is isolated from production environments and allows for experimentation and iteration.

- **Prod Environment**: The production environment where the final infrastructure is deployed. It is the live environment that serves the actual users.

## Configuration

To configure the Terraform environments, follow these steps:

1. Open the `terraform.tfvars` file in the root directory of the project.

2. Set the appropriate values for the environment-specific variables. For example, you might need to specify the AWS region, account ID, and other environment-specific settings.

3. Save the changes to the `terraform.tfvars` file.

## Usage

To use the Terraform environments, follow these steps:

1. Change to the desired environment directory using the `cd` command. For example, to switch to the dev environment, run:

   ```shell
   cd dev
   ```

2. Initialize the Terraform environment by running the following command:

   ```shell
   terraform init
   ```

3. Review the planned changes by running the following command:

   ```shell
   terraform plan
   ```

4. If the planned changes look correct, apply the changes by running the following command:

   ```shell
   terraform apply
   ```

   **Note:** Be cautious when applying changes to the production environment. Make sure to thoroughly review the changes and test them in the dev environment before applying them to production.

By following these steps, you can create and manage the Terraform environments for your project.
