# Project Overview

This project aims to provision and manage infrastructure resources using Terraform. It provides a scalable and automated approach to deploy and maintain the required infrastructure components.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a reliable and scalable infrastructure that supports the application's requirements. It enables easy provisioning and management of resources in a consistent and repeatable manner.

## Architecture

The project architecture consists of the following components:

- **AWS Accounts**: The project utilizes separate AWS accounts for different environments, such as development and production. This allows for isolation and better control over resources.

- **Terraform Modules**: The infrastructure is organized into reusable modules, each responsible for provisioning a specific set of resources. These modules promote consistency and modularity.

- **CloudFront**: The project leverages CloudFront for content delivery and caching. It provides improved performance and scalability for the application.

- **S3 Buckets**: S3 buckets are used for storing static assets and hosting the application's website. They provide durable and scalable object storage.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. Install Terraform on your machine if it is not already installed.

3. Configure your AWS credentials by setting the appropriate environment variables or using the AWS CLI.

4. Navigate to the desired environment directory, such as `dev` or `prod`.

5. Initialize the Terraform environment by running `terraform init`.

6. Review the planned changes by running `terraform plan`.

7. If the planned changes look correct, apply the changes by running `terraform apply`.

By following these steps, you can set up and run the project infrastructure.
